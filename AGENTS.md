# Release Synchronization

- Synchronize releases only when the user requests an update. Do not create
  scheduled synchronization jobs.
- Compare this repository's package version with all stable npm versions of
  `@ljwei-stak/model-router-galgame` using semantic version ordering. Never
  downgrade either side or assume the `latest` tag is the highest version.
- When npm is newer, recover the corresponding complete source checkout and
  verify its published files against the npm tarball before pushing GitHub.
  The npm package currently excludes client source, scripts, tests, and assets;
  importing the tarball alone is not a complete source synchronization.
- When GitHub is newer, run tests and verify the generated client, then publish
  that same version and verify the registry payload. Do not add features or bump
  the version solely to synchronize an existing release.
- Equal version numbers require equal package contents. npm versions cannot be
  overwritten; report conflicting contents instead of silently replacing them.
- Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `npm test`, `npm run check:client`, and
  `pnpm peers check`. A skipped client build does not count as validation. The
  repository pins the DSH SDK needed to reproduce the client build.
- Keep the release's `v<version>` tag on its verified source commit. Never move
  an existing tag or force-push over concurrent work.
- Preserve all older npm versions, Git tags, and GitHub Releases. Publish new
  code changes under a new version; never unpublish or delete release history
  as part of synchronization.
- Create or update the published GitHub Release for that tag, with release
  notes and the verified npm tarball. A pushed tag alone is not a GitHub Release.
  Verify the public release page and its assets before reporting completion.
- Preserve published file bytes, including line endings, and verify the final
  GitHub checkout against npm after pushing.
